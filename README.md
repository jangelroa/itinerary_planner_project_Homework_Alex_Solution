    * an origin 
    * a destination
    * a name
  * not required
    * a departure date
    * a return date

* Add **Waypoints** to an **Itinerary** with:
  * required fields:
    * a location
    * a name
    * a date (must be between the itinerary start and end date)
   
* Add one or more **Travel Partners** to the **Itinerary**
  * required fields:
    * first name
    * last name
    * email

* Associate a **Travel Partner** with a **Waypoint**
  * Note: Think about the kind of relationship this entails
